I do not believe there are an particular compiling needs. 
Two requirements for server:
logininfo.txt must be in the same directory as Nagaffne_hw1_server.java
To get meaningful results the users are currently limited to the contents of the text file so far:
joesmith,324758823
johndoe,123456789
janeaeroplane,465230921
peterheater,565432121

When inputting data in client:
Case does not matter
As long as appended username matches the text file server will return record

Server ipaddress being sent to is 127.0.0.1
Port 3000 must be open for server
Port 3001 must be open for client
